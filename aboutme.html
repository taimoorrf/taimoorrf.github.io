			I hail from Faisalabad, an industrial city in Pakistan. 
			Problem solving had always been a passion of mine, something that translated into academic pursuit when I took up Computer Science as my major during my ungdergraduate studies at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. 
			Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Information Science at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. 
			My interests include music, weightlifting, sports, and literature.

			Will write about some of my personal work e.g writings on music etc here. Haven't decided it yet.
